Notes on the startup script. 

Put obdgpslogger in the 
/etc/defaults
as
obdgpslogger

Then link to  the using the name S36obdgpslogger
/etc/rc5.d 

ln -s /etc/defaults/obdgpslogger /etc/rc5.d/S36obdgpslogger

You should actually go to those folders when creating the links. For some reason it only worked when I went to the folder. 

It should create a database in the /home/root folder.
