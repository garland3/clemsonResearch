This code is being used by Anthony Garland for his Master's thesis

I'm working on vibration analysis of automobiles. I plan to do wavelet analysis on the vibrations to determine the health of the engine. 

The code here is slightly modfied from obdgpslogger to fit my needs. I plan to log obd, gps, tach, and accel data from the automobile while it is running. The obdgpslogger code will call a second program that will log the accel and tach data when the autombile goes into a regime of interest.
