This code is being used by Anthony Garland for his Master's thesis

I'm working on vibration analysis of automobiles. I plan to do wavelet analysis on the vibrations to determine the health of the engine. 

The main code that I'm using is obdgpslogger. You can get it at. 
svn co svn://svn.icculus.org/obdgpslogger/trunk obdgpslogger

The version in this repo is a patched version that works on ubuntu. The original code from svn works on the overo gumstick. 

Scripts, data, and other misc. stuff are also here.
